Pepper Perceived Intelligence
----------------------------

Our project focuses on creating an engaging and intelligent interaction experience between the robot and users, through Choregraphe, a visual programming tool for creating robot behaviors for NAO or Pepper.

Our goal is to improve the perceived intelligence of the robot by incorporating various elements such as dialogues, movements in space and timeline-based interactions. 

In this repository, you will find the Choregraphe (.crg) file containing the code for our application, as well as a video demonstration (.mp4) showcasing the functionality and interaction with the robot. Additionally, we have conducted statistical testing on the results obtained through the Goodspeed questionnaire to analyze the effectiveness of our application in achieving our goal.
